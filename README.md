A program to read from an Enphase Envoy on the local network. Reads electricity consumed and produced instantaneously, that day, the last seven days, and the lifetime of the envoy.

Tested on the original Envoy (production data only) and the Envoy S (production and consumption data).

Original Envoy: http://envoy/api/v1/production

Envoy S: http://envoy/production.json
